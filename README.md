I created this program in 2016 to test multi-threaded programming.  This is my attempt at a Pi calculator that uses the Gregoryâ€“Leibniz series algorithm.  Because of how the algorithm works, I can easily split up the calculations between several threads and bring it together in the end.  Although it works fairly well, I'll more than likely fully redo this program at some point in the future to fix several issues I found with this version.  The main file in this program is [UserInterface.cs](https://github.com/tbtaco/Pi/blob/master/Pi/UserInterface.cs).  It has plenty of comments explaining more.
